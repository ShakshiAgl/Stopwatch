# Stopwatch
This is a stopwatch demonstration of a clock coded on 22th May myself after understanding 
its implementation from several youtube series.

# Implementation
* The stopwatch has two buttons START and RESET
* The Start button automatically turns to Stop button once the timer is started
* The Stop button pauses the timer
* The Reset button clears all the record and reinitializes the timer

# Find a bug?
I would encourage to get any bug issue solved in the code.
